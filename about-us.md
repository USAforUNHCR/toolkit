<h1>About The Hive</h1>
<p>
  The Hive is a special project of USA for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, formed to be an instrument for engaging Americans around the refugee crisis and for finding new ways to mobilize action, build awareness and knowledge about issues relating to refugees. The Hive innovation lab uses advanced data science to develop groundbreaking new models for consumer engagement. The Hive is working to unlock the potential of the US market – both in terms of advocacy and fundraising – in support of refugees and related issues.

<h1>About UNHCR</h1>
<p>
  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as the UN Refugee Agency, is the world’s leading organization aiding and protecting people forced to flee their homes due to violence, conflict and persecution. UNHCR provides shelter, food, water, medical care, and other life- saving assistance to refugees around the world.
</p>
<p>
  The dream of most refugees is to return home. When possible, UNHCR helps refugees return to their homeland. When refugees can’t go back home, UNHCR   helps them rebuild their lives in another country. Since its formation by the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, UNHCR has helped an estimated 50 million refugees restart their lives and has twice received the Nobel Peace Prize.
