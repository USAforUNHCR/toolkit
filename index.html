    <p>What can we do about a crisis that affects us all and yet, seems so far away?</p>
    <p>Become a "Welcoming Communities" Ambassador</p>
    <p>Welcoming Communities is a special project of the UN Refugee Agency, focused on engaging Americans about the refugee crisis and about the benefits refugees bring to their local communities.</p>
    <p>A staggering 60 million people have fled their homes and are struggling to survive, whether that is in their own or neighboring countries. This is a humanitarian, political, and economic crisis that has an impact on our communities.</p>
    <p>While this crisis might seem far away on TV, in reality there are refugees all over the United States contributing to their communities and strengthening their local economies.</p>
    <p>We know that one-on-one connections and personal relationships are how we will get people to care about this issue and solve this crisis. That is where you come in. With materials we’ll provide for you, you’ll have all the tools you need to take action in your community. With the global refugee crisis exploding over the last few years, this work is particularly critical right now. We are growing a grassroots network of support from the ground up – starting with people like you.</p>

    <p>We are a nation of immigrants. At one time, our ancestors traveled from every corner of the globe and settled in the United States. Many of them were forced to flee persecution or unlivable conditions. Whatever their reason for embarking on that uncertain voyage, our families’ courage has made our lives better.</p>
    <p>“The Great American Melting Pot” is what makes our country great. The waves of immigration to American shores have woven a fabric unlike any other country in the world. Americans stick together. We take care of our neighbors. We know that when we work together to help others, we end up helping ourselves and our whole communities.</p>
    <p>Since 1975 the United States has resettled approximately 3 million refugees. Today we face a crisis unlike any seen since World War II. But the solution will come through in small actions, taken by everyday Americans at the local level. Through education and relationship building, just as we have built up our communities in the past, we can make all our communities welcoming for refugees. As global leaders, we need to foster community engagement and embrace our new neighbors to effectively build opportunity for all.</p>
